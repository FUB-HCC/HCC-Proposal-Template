\section*{Guidelines}
\emph{Please remove this section before handing in your proposal.}

You should plan 3--4 feedback rounds for finalizing your proposal.
Before handing in the proposal to your supervisor or your reviewer, please check if your proposal fulfills the following criteria:

\begin{todolist}
  \item A proposal for a BSc thesis should have five pages of text. Excluding the title page, timeline, references, and outline.
  \item A proposal for a MSc thesis should have 10--20 pages (maximum).
  \item Your proposal has to include a research question. This has to be in the form of a sentence ending with a question mark.
  \item Include the assumed deadline for handing in your thesis in the timeline.
  \item Define a short, significant title which reflects clearly the contents of your thesis.
  \item Use American English: (BE) Visualisation $\rightarrow$ (AE) Visualization.
  \item The proposal and also the final thesis can be written in German or English. If you use German, please adapt the latex template on your own.
  \item  The proposal should be comprehensible, so that not only specialists can understand it.
  \item Use correct formal language, correct spelling and grammar.
  \item Use correct citation, use the ACM citation style, and avoid plagiarism. In severe cases, plagiarism can result in exmatriculation.
 
\end{todolist}

\subsection*{Where to find literature?}
Be aware that the HCC conducts research in the areas of Human-Computer Interaction and Collaborative Computing. Therefore, articles from the following conferences are of particular interest\footnote{Upcoming conference are listed on the website of the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction: \url{https://sigchi.org/conferences/upcoming-conferences/}}: 

\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em % This should move to the global layout section.
    \item CHI - Human Factors in Computing Systems
    \item CSCW - Computer Supported Cooperative Work
    \item IUI - International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces
    \item DIS - Designing Interactive Systems Conference
\end{itemize}

You can find the publications of these conference in the Digital Library of ACM: \url{https://dl.acm.org/}. As opposed to using Google Scholar (\url{https://scholar.google.com/}), the papers are already contextualized, and you can make sure that the work is relevant. If you have doubts, talk to your supervisor.

\subsection*{What is a human-centered design approach?}
At HCC, we always apply a human-centered design approach. This approach is taught in the \emph{Human-Computer Interaction I} course. If you are not familiar with this approach, you need to learn it before starting with your thesis. Please contact your supervisor to get access to the slides and videos of the course. In order to reach your goals, you have to make sure that you understand which research methods are most suitable to fulfill your goals. We recommend reviewing available methods and their practical application in the field of human-computer interaction~\cite{lazar2017research, olson2014ways}. Both mentioned sources, and additional books are available at the HCC's library. Please talk to your supervisor.
