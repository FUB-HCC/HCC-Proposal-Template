\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% Introduction to the topic.
% Explain why this work is important giving a general introduction to the subject,
% list the basic knowledge needed and outline the purpose of the report. 
%************************************************************************
This section should start with a short thematic introduction of your planned thesis. This includes describing the context of your thesis, your subject area, and the domain or field you are in. You need to describe your research motivation and its relevance in Section~\ref{subsec:motivation}. Also, you need to specify a precise research gap and the resulting aim of your work and specific research questions in Section~\ref{subsec:goal}.

\subsection{Motivation}
\label{subsec:motivation}
% Motivation and relevance of the topic.
%************************************************************************
In this section, you should motivate why the problem you are tackling matters and why this is relevant. You want to give the reader enough background knowledge to understand your problem in order to understand your approach. Therefore, introduce the reader to all the necessary fields your research question is part of. Give an overview of why this is interesting. Please illustrate your problem by using an example.

%************************************************************************
\subsection{Goal}
\label{subsec:goal}
% Gap you want to close with your research.
% Goal of your work.
% Your research question.
% List the main research question(s) you want to answer.
% Explain whether your research will provide a definitive answer or simply contribute towards an answer
%************************************************************************
This part of the expose is the most important one since you have to specify the objectives~(goal) of your thesis. The goal of your thesis should be as specific as possible. You also need to outline \emph{what} contribution you are making and \emph{where} you want to make a contribution. By where we mean which field of research. Please make sure that the goals are realistic and that you are able to evaluate your goals. Please list the main research question(s) you want to answer. Explain whether your research will provide a
definitive answer or simply contribute towards an answer.

	\textbf{Distinction between Bachelor and Master theses}\vspace{2mm}\\
    \textbf{BSc Thesis} &
    For a BSc thesis, the actual implementation is often a goal. Therefore a thoughtful application of the Human-Centered Design approach~\cite{gulliksenKeyPrinciplesUsercentred2003, dis20109241} is sufficient. \vspace{2mm}\\
	\textbf{MSc Thesis} &
	In the case of a MSc thesis, a scientific objective needs to be clearly stated and a scientific contribution has to be made. Accoring to \cite{contributionTypes2016} there are seven different contribution types in HCI: theoretical, methodological, empirical, artifact, dataset, survey, and opinion contribution.\vspace{2mm}\\
