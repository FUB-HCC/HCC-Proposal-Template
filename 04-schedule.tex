\section{Project Plan}
\label{sec:plan}
We consider Bachelor's and Master's Thesis as projects. Projects are based on a plan, and each plan needs milestones\footnote{By milestone we mean a collection of tasks, which need to be finished by a specific date. You can also call it a work package.} and a timeline. Thus, in this section, you will break down your thesis project into manageable and specific milestones to realistically guess the time you will need. Especially if you will use methods for the first time, it's best to consult someone more experienced. It would help if you thought about each milestone, what you exactly will do in that phase, what order, the result or outcome of each step will be, and how this pays towards the goal of your thesis project. As a result, you will sketch a detailed timeline for your upcoming work.


According to the exam regulations: a Bachelor thesis\footnote{Please read \S~10 of the Study and Examination regulations for the bachelor’s degree program: \url{https://www.imp.fu-berlin.de/fbv/pruefungsbuero/Studien--und-Pruefungsordnungen/StOPO_BSc_Inf_-2014.pdf}, accessed May 16, 2021} takes about 360~hours (12~LP) and a Master thesis\footnote{Please read \S~9 of the Study and Examination regulations for the master’s
degree program: \url{https://www.imp.fu-berlin.de/fbv/pruefungsbuero/Studien--und-Pruefungsordnungen/STOPO_MSc_-Inf_-2014.pdf}, accessed May 16, 2021} is calculated with 900~hours (30~LP).

\begin{todolist}
  \itemsep0em % This should move to the global layout section.
  \item Calculate the hours you can effectively work on your thesis per week.
  \item Write down the planned date of handing in your thesis.
  \item Include up to 40\% buffer in case of unforeseen problems (e.g., sickness, vacation).
  \item Include a Gantt-Chart.
\end{todolist}

\subsection{Milestones}
\label{subsec:milestone}
Write down the milestones of your upcoming project. Please specify when you will achieve which milestone and what artifact(s) or outcome will result from each milestone. Also, keep in mind what the goal of each milestone is.

\subsection{Timeline}
\label{subsec:timeline}
Now you need to transfer the milestones into a timeline. The time for your thesis will help you to set realistic time goals and maybe reconsider milestones. Use a Gantt chart\footnote{Check out Wikipedia for an extended overview of project management software that fits your needs: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_project_management_software}. For example Ganttproject is free of charge and open source: \url{https://www.ganttproject.biz/}, accessed: May 26, 2021} for visualization. Please consider what tasks you can do in parallel. Also indicate how you will handle the writing process within your timeline.
